    Despite the name, the Fields of Conflict is not a place of murder or death, instead the residents of this land sort
    out their disputes like reasonable individuals: by holding debates, playing war-games, or stabbing each other in the
    face. Only when they disagree with each other, of course, they're not savages, and Archfey Fracas will punch anyone
    who says otherwise!

    The strange magic that permeates this area means injuries are short-lived and even normally fatal strikes do little
    but bruise the ego of the loser, which they believe is a fate far worse than death. Perhaps conflict is not quite
    so black and white?
