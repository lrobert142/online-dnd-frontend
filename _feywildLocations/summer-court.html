    The Summer Court is soothing, laid-back, and very atypical of most other Feywild lands. Being overseen by "Arch-bro"
    Sol the residents here are very relaxed, calm, and friendly with all who viist; even those not native to the
    Feywilds.

    Don't be fooled though, the constant sunshine and heat - to say nothing of exotic 'spices' cultivated here - can
    quickly lead to dehydration and death. And don't expect the residents to help, you'd just be tossed aside for
    "harshing their vibes".
