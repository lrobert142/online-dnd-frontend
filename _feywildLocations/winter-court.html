    A land that is constantly covered in snow, ransacked by blizzards, and destitute of life save for that which has the
    strongest will to survive, it is nonetheless a beautiful and awe-inspiring court. Archfey Kaldr's fondness for her
    realm ensures that those who do attempt to settle in her land are treated with care befitting their strong wills.

    The residents themselves, while quite frosty initially, are known to look after their own with a fire in their heart
    that is matched only by Archfey Kaldr's own. It is said they are able to cultivate unique vegetation that can be
    grown only in this court, and have developed a drink that warms minds, souls, and bodies (particularly the loins).
