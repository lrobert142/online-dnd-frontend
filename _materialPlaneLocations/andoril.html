<p>
    Embracing the openness of their lord deity, Bahamut, they are the most diverse country of Navirar. Their open
    acceptance of all religions and encouragement of cross-country interactions has led to them becoming the largest
    kingdom on the continent and one of the most well known and respected.

    The land is a melting pot of different cultures and races which have become so diverse that many consider it a
    regular part of life when interacting with races that are normally uncommon such as the Drow, Yuan-Ti, or Goliath.
