    By far the largest city in Andoril and the capital of the country, this city is also one of the largest on
    Navirar. With it's many districts and the incredibly diverse number of races that both call it home and visit
    it, it is a venerable melting pot of cultures, ideals, knowledge.

    The city is also known for its unique approach to Divine worship, opting to have entire temples built for
    well-known and worshipped non-evil deities instead of a singular segmented temple (which is common in other
    countries). This approach has resulted in the city growing quite large to accommodate new districts of Divine
    worship and facilities for various rituals.

<p>
    Beyond Divine worship, the city is also known for the large number of adventurers and heroes, with many shops
    offering everything needed for both new adventurers and celebrated heroes to undertake even the harshest of
    journeys. Blacksmiths, alchemists, master craftsmen of all kinds line the massive market district to peddle
    all manner of both mundane and esoteric goods.

    But above all its most incredible achievement is the enormous temple to Bahamut that lies in the center of
    the city. Doubling as the castle from which the great King Aldis and Queen Sianne Raverex rule, the enormous
    platinum-plated statue of Bahamut can be seen from anywhere in the city; truly a dedication worthy of the Lord
    Dragon's favour!
