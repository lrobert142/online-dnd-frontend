    Once a proud collection of towers dedicated to the study and worship of the Divine, time has not been kind to these
    stones, and they have long since crumbled into ruins. Though some rooms remain intact and even the altars are still
    whole, it is clear this place is a shadow of its former self.

    The taint of the goblins who have taken up refuge in this once holy place and use it as a major base of operation
    for their raiding and plundering bring disgrace upon the land itself! Not that that bothers the goblins any.

    After cutting a bloody swathe through the residents and forcing the leader to surrender, the party was able to
    extract a crucial hostage safely and escape before reinforcements could arrive.

    Perhaps now the defilement of this holy area will relent and the gods can reclaim these once-worship-filled ruins
    for a more worthy purpose.
