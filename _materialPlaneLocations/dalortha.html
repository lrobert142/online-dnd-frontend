    The people of this land are hardy and reliable - much like their deity, Torm, and despite the harshness of the land
    they are very adept at farming it, able to cultivate crops that many others have difficulty even understanding how
    to produce. Known to honor their word no matter what, they have attained a healthy respected relationship with the
