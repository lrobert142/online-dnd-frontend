    Not originally part of the world, this continent-island was created from a piece of Tiamatâ€™s plane when she tried to
    invade the world in the late second era. Unfathomably rich with natural resources, it is frequented by those who
    wish to trade, and watched over by the Five Emperors - five great dragons that protect the land and sea from any who
    would try to cause harm to their land or their people.

    Many rumours abound about this strange and exciting continent, enough that determining what is real and what is a
    tall tale is quite difficult to understand. Perhaps in time more will be discovered?
