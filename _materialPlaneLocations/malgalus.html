    The people of this land are incredibly kind, caring, and devoted to goodness in all forms. It is common to see them
    as wandering heroes, healers, and spiritual guides and are known to stand against overwhelming odds even when they
    have no chance of success if it may allow others to escape.

    Of note is that it is common to see the most devout engage in self-flagellation as a way to relieve the pain of
    their god Illmater, though they notably do not force this upon others.
