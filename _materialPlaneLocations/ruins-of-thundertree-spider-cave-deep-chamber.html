<p>
    A massive chamber deep in the heart of the spiders' nest, it is covered in spider silk that is much more fine
    and delicate than the webs outside. It does not appear to be made to capture prey, perhaps this is a hatchery?
    The back of the chamber looks to have been broken through the stone wall and patched up with stronger, stickier
    silk. Looking past it reveals a long drop into total darkness, likely leading all the way to the Underdark
    where the spiders must have originally come from.

    By providing assistance, the party was able to bring down the creature that threatened the spiders' nest and
    ensure the entrance to the Underdark was properly sealed up again. How delightful!
