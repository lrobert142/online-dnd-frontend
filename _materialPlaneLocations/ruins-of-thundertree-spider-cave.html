<p>
    Underneath the Ruins of Thundertree, spiders have emerged from the Underdark and made the sprawling cave
    system their lair. Filled with webs, spiders of all ages and sizes, and a scary number of victims (some
    animals, some humanoid) it seems the spiders have been building this out for a while. Even the stone looks to
    have chipped away in parts, a clear indication of the spiders' needs to grow their space.

    By making peace with the spiders and helping them remove a monstrosity that sought to kill, devour, or
    enslave the innocent arachnids that resides there, the party was able to successfully secure the spiders' home
    without any unnecessary bloodshed. Even the spiders seemed to think highly of them!
