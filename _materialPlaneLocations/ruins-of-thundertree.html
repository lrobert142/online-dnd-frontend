    Once a prosperous community of woodcutters and trappers, a magical mishap caused the destruction of the town
    and zombification of several residents. Fearing for their lives, those who didn't perish fled leaving the
    town to wither and crumble away. Now it is home to various animals and plants as nature works to recover a
    land devoid of civilian activities.

    Once a frequent hideout for Reidoth, after a dragon settled the area the party was contacted to scare it off
    and restore peace. However, the great beast - Venomfang - was unwilling to listen to reason and so was
    subsequently slain.

    Now the town is empty again, save for the giant spiders that make their nest under the town, and the twig
    blights that occasionally roam through the desolate streets.
