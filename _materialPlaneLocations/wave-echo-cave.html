    The rich mine of the Phandelver’s Pact that was lost hundreds of years ago during large-scale orc invasions that
    devastated this part of Andoril. Countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, seeking its
    abundance of rich ore, gems, and the magical workshop known as the Forge of Spells, where Divine and Arcane mages of
    old enchanted all manner of items and weapons.
</p>
<p>
    The mine had been lost for so long that many questioned if it was real or just a myth made up to lure foolish
    treasure-seeking adventurers to their doom. Until the Rockseeker brother chanced upon an ancient encoded map that
    revealed the location of this once-lost-to-time location. Now the race is on, between the Rockseeker brothers and
    the mysterious Black Spider.

    Through grit and determination, the party was able to free Gundren and learn the location of the mine. However, they
    were not the first to arrive as the Black Spider had deciphered the map and was setting up defences inside as they
    attempted to claim the forgotten mine for themselves. Evidently the mine was not quite as abandoned as they had
    hoped, however, and the numerous hostile creatures within seem to have ground their plans to overtake it to a halt.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps this delay will serve as the Black Spider's undoing?
</p>

    The mine was indeed as treacherous as it seemed, with many dangerous creatures lying in the shadows waiting for
    fresh meat to stumble into their clutches. From blood-sucking Stirges to ravenous Ghouls to even a "Huge Ass Flaming
    Skull That Wasn't That Big And Was Actually Kind Of Smallish, A Normal Sized Small Big Ass Flying Skull That Was
    Also Flaming And Talking™" the place was filled with walking nightmares.
</p>
<p>
    And yet, it did not deter the party who fought through the residents of the cave, the goblin reinforcements, and
    deftly navigated around the traps to confront the Black Spider and finally take them down once and for all. Though
    the Skull and a mysterious voice in a locked burned-out stone shack remains, the mine is much quieter and calmer
    with the Black Spider now knocked out and removed from his lofty position of power.
</p>

<p>
    The Rockseeker brothers have vowed to get the mine back up and running in dedication to their brother, Tharden, who
    sadly passed away. It will take some time to get it safely running again, but the Rockseeker brothers are resolute
    in their goal. Only time will tell just how successful they will be.
