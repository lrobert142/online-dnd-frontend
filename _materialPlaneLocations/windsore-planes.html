<p>
    A quite isolated farming town that is nevertheless renowned in Illuxtria for the surprisingly delicious and
    filling turnips that are carefully cultivated by the proud rabbitfolk who grow them. Many have asked how they
    are able to grow such tasty vegetables so consistently, but even now the secret remains known only to the
    townsfolk.

    Generally quite friendly towards outsiders, the villagers here often find themselves frequented by wandering
    performers travelling between Illuxtria and Hypnia and are no stranger to hosting guests. As long as you stay
    on their good side they are quite wonderful hosts, just don't try to pick up any of the rabbitfolk or you'll
    soon discover just how powerful their legs can be.
