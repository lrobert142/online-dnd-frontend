    A tiny and quiet village that was established by a retired adventurer - Pete "Peet" McBuggins - nearly
    30 years ago when he stepped away from his duties to settle back into a simple lifestyle. Though originally
    just one house and a simple field, its proximity to the Andoril-Malgalus trade route eventually led to more
    people setting up in the area until it became the small village it is today.

    Growing a small variety of hardy vegetables and grains, and hunting the plentiful animals in the surrounding
    forests, the village is entirely nearly self-sufficient though does sometimes trade with passing caravans
    to obtain more exotic or difficult-to-make goods.

    They seem to prefer hunting alongside animals, particularly wolves!
