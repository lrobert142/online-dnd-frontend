    Formerly the home of a large and dangerous nest of wyverns, a band of bold adventurers was able to deal with
    the monsters years ago leaving the location empty for many years. Unfortunately, with the wyverns slain other
    less-savory creatures now use its hidden and defended location to set up camp. Orcish raiders are the latest
    inhabitants, seeing it as the perfect location to ambush and kill unsuspecting travellers.

    Though the savage brutes fought viciously - and even brought in an orge to try to turn the tables - they were
    no match for the valiant heroes who triumphed over them. Now the tor is once again empty of threats, let's
    hope it stays that way for a while longer.
