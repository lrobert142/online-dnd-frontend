<p>
    A kindly, gentle woman who deals with the town's residents in place of her husband, Harbin, when it comes to
    complaints, feedback, and planning requests. She hopes that by filtering out the noise and absurd requests,
    her husband will have an easier time and be less stressed and vocal. That's yet to happen.

<p>
    Although she may show open displeasure for his loud rants and questionable interactions with people, she
    does love her husband deeply and hopes that old age will cause to mellow out. And if not, she'll be right
    there to pull him in line.
