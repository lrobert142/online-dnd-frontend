<blockquote>

    "A powerful diviner in life, she foresaw the fall of Old Owl Well and her own death at the hands of raiders.
    Yet death did not scare her, nor did it sway her from warning and helping others escape. Even in her final
    moments - as the stones around her legs dragged her deeper into the well and water filled her lungs - she
    remained calm and composed. For she knew that death was not the end, it was merely a new beginning."
    - An excerpt from 'Legends of Phandalin: The Great Diviner'

    Even as a banshee, Agatha still has incredible divination skills and may be willing to help those who ask
    for her assistance, provided they show proper reverence for one of her status and power. Gifts are always
    appreciated as well; what self-respecting diviner doesn't appreciate a little flattery?

    The party was able to get on Agatha's good side and she not only divined information about Bowgentleâ€™s
    spellbook, but also helped them fend off the undead plaguing the fort.
