    Son of Qelline Alderleaf, he tends the fields alongside his father during the day and (begrudgingly) studies
    at night. He hopes to one day leave Phandalin and travel to a big city where he can become a scholar, though
    he is aware he has a long way to go to achieve his dream.

    Ever the one to love exploring the town and it's surroundings, his adventures led to him discovering a secret
    tunnel the party was able to use to infiltrate the Redbrands. He likes to think it was because of his discovery
    that the party were able to drive them off at all.
