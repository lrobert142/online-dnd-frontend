<p>
    A goblin of no renown, from a family of no power, with little skills and even less smarts; it is little
    wonder he was enslaved by bugbears. Their whipping boy, he spent much of his time begging for scraps of food
    and trying to avoid frequent bullying and beatings.

<p>
    Freed from his slavery by the party, he feels he owes them deeply and has thrown himself wholeheartedly into
    his job with Linene who - much to his relief and confusion - has treated him as an equal.
