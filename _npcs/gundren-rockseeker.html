    Middle brother of the Rockseeker trio, Gundren is loud, boisterous, good-natured, and almost always deep in his cups
    particularly the Firewine ale from his homeland of Rathex. Despite his appearance - and penchant for strong booze -
    he is quite well-learned about the past and has a deep desire to uncover its mysteries, particularly those
    associated with mining and stonecutting.
</p>
<p>
    After many long years of investigating rumours, dead ends, and pure speculation that turned out to be lies, he
    finally chanced upon a real lead in Baldur's Gate that lead to him uncovering a map that lead to the long-lost Mine
    of Phandelver. Word spread quickly and Gundren and his brothers were able to re-establish the frontier town of
    Phandalin before their arrival.

    The party was able to find Gundren and rescue him before the bugbear could sell off the map and 'dispose' of the
    dwarf. Though it was clear he'd suffered a fair bit at the hands of the goblins, he was brought back to Phandalin
    safely and able to make a full recovery, celebrating with a night of Firewine ale.

<p>
    Worried about the mine and his brothers, he asks the party to help him one last time by securing the mine and
    clearing out any 'undesirables'. He also asks them to send his brothers back to Phandalin if they should chance
    across them.
