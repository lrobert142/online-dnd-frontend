    "Being a mayor is stressful; managing every little thing and having everyone look up to you is a lot, you know?
    It can turn even the best man into a grumpy irate shell of his former self. Which makes me wonder if Harbin
    was a mayor before he arrived here, because he's always been a grumpy #@*&^!" - Common joke amongst patrons
    of Stonehill Inn after a few mugs of ale.

    A confrontational yet cowardly lizard who clashes openly with others regularly and insists that everything
    he does is for "the good of the town", he is not well liked by residents of Phandalin.
