    Corrupt, selfish, and cowardly are just a few words to describe this treacherous wizard. Once a member of
    the Lord's Alliance, he abandoned them beliving they were 'too safe' and joined up with the Redbrands.

    Quickly becoming a leader of the sect in Phandalin, he used his natural charisma and cunning to extort funds
    from the town while secretly working with the mysterious Black Spider.
