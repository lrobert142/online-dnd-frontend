    Overworked, overstressed, and underpaid. Linene nearly single-handedly runs the trading post in Phandalin,
    the only true connection the frontier town has with the outside world. She is often found balancing books,
    taking stock, and making deals with miners and adventures alike.
</p>
<p>
    Despite what some people may think, she has a strong sense of fairness and ensures her new workers are well
    looked after and fairly paid.

    Her latest worker, Droop, has removed a lot of stress, and she is openly quite proud of him.
