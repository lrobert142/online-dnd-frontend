    The mysterious figure behind the Redbrand's presence in Phandalin. They seem to have a deep interest in the
    Phandelver mine, though what for or why remains completely mystery.

    The party encountered the nefarious Black Spider deep in the Phandelver Mine after a vicious fight to the mysterious
    leader. Though his deception and disarming charisma was enough to establish himself amongst his goblin allies, he

    Bound, gagged, and dragged back to Phandalin to face justice for his crimes, he is now awaiting a lengthy prison
    sentence in Neverwinter. May he never see the light of day again.
