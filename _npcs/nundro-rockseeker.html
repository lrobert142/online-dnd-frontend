<p>
    Youngest brother of the Rockseekers trio, Nundro is a proud, nervous, and very excitable priest of Labelas Enoreth
    who looks up to his brothers and wishes to use his Divine arts to help them uncover the mysteries of the past.
    Though sometimes a little naive, his overwhelming positivity and care for all those around him is infectious and
    rarely fails to uplift the spirits of those around him.

    His current whereabouts are unknown, though a journal entry from Tharden indicates he might be being held captive in
    Phandelver Mine. Why would he be somewhere like that?
