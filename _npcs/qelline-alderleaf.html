<p>
    A hard-working farmer who spends his days working the fields with his son, Carp, and his nights trying to
    teach him how to read and write so that "he can have a better life than I did."

    Though he may come off as short-tempered - though don't use the S-word around him - he is generally a quite
    agreeable person. As long as you don't use the S-word around him (then all bets are off!)
