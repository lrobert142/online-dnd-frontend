    A wilding who prefers the company of animals and plants over the noise and hustle of the town, they often
    spend long periods of time in the wilderness beyond Phandalin. They are soft-spoken and rarely say more than
    is necessary, often giving the outward appearance of a uncaring individual.

    Recently they have been snooping on the cultists that have moved into the ruins of Thundertree and trying
    to avoid angering the dragon that has made its home there.
