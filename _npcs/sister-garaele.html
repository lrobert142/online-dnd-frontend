    A kindly woman of the cloth who cares for the town with simple medicines and prayers, she can often be found
    by her shrine lighting incense and silently praying for the protection and good fortune of Phandalin and all
    who reside in it.

    become much more light-hearted; even cracking a smile on occasion.

    Upon learning the location of Bowgentle's spellbook from the party she revealed that she was a Harper and
    extended an invitation to join their ranks. She is happy to wait as long as needed for their answer, but
    stressed that her position must be kept a secret from others if she is to work effectively.
