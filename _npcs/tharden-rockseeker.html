    Oldest brother of the Rockseeker trio, Tharden is the quietest and most-levelheaded of the three and sees it as his
    duty to keep his much more unruly brothers in-check and safe. When not running after his brothers, he prefers to
    quietly takes notes in his journal of their various adventures, from mundane daily lives in cities to the excitement
    of finding a long-lost mine and piece of history.

    Unfortunately it seems his desire to protect his dear brothers lead to his downfall as his body was discovered at
    the entrance to the Phandelver Mine, it's chest seemingly exploded from the inside out. The final entries in his
    journal indicates that Nundro was captured and being held hostage further in and despite him knowing it was a bad
    idea he felt he had no choice but to try to save him.

<blockquote>
    "I'm sorry, Gundren, I really am, but he's in there somewhere and I have to save him. It's what big brothers do,
    it's what I do. Please forgive me." - The second to last entry in Tharden's journal, the final entry being too
    covered in blood to read.
