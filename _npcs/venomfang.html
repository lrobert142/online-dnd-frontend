<p>
    A young dragon that has recently taken to making the ruins Thundertree its home. Ill-tempered, conniving,
    and "clearly superior to a mortal in every aspect" (according to himself), getting on his bad side is not
    recommended.

    Despite his nimble claws and poisoned promises, his hide was no match against steel and spell and now he
    speaks his honeyed lies no longer.
