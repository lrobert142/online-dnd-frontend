<p>
    A cruel, manipulative, power-hungry goblin who thinks only of himself. He believes his position as shaman
    means he is owed leadership of the tribe, though he would never say this out loud less he draw the ire of Klarg.
    Like the rest of the goblins, he lives in fear and hatred of the bugbear.

    Though he managed to capture the party at one point, his arrogance and hunger for power led to his downfall
    and summary execution when they escaped. Now his manipulative words are no more.
