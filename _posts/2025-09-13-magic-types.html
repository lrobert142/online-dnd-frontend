    <p>
        Magic is abundant in all planes of existence and comes in three major categories: Arcane, Divine, and Nature.
        These
        forms of magic can be harnessed in similar fashions - indeed some spells can even span multiple categories - but
        are
        distinct from each other in many ways.

    <h2>Arcane</h2>
    <p>
        It is present in all planes of existence and is a fundamental energy that flows through all of them. It does not
        seem to directly come from a particular location, plane, or item but rather appears to be the energy that ties
        all worlds together. It is free moving and has no home or origin, it simply is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of its raw, unfiltered nature as pure energy it can be easily transformed into all manner of spells,
        imbued into artefacts, and coerced into new and interesting forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be wary though, as Arcane magic can be tainted which results in it not being able to be folded correctly and
        often results in spells going awry. Usually with messy and fatal results.

    <h2>Divine</h2>
    <p>
        Magic that has been filtered through gods - or other equally powerful and revered entities - and passed through
        to those deemed worthy. Without an entity to channel the magic through, Divine magic simply does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        This category of magic can be stolen and redirected, but it cannot be created and thus does not inherently
        ‘exist’ anywhere. Faith and belief in gods allows it to be amplified to exceptional levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Divine magic can be muted which means the magic cannot be channeled correctly resulting in failed spells or
        misfires (friendly fire, smaller/larger AoE, etc.)

    <img class="sigil float-left" src="{{ 'assets/img/lore/nature.png' | relative_url }}"
         alt="Nature magic sigil"/>
    <h2>Nature</h2>
    <p>
        By far the most esoteric and unusual type of magic, Nature magic draws power from the plane itself, not just
        physically - like grass and trees - but spiritually - like life, death, healing, evolution, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nature magic is believed to be what allows a plane to exist at all and keep its form. Without nature magic, a
        plane would dissipate into nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nature magic can be corrupted or poisoned which usually also has effects on the physical landscape and causes
        the magic to cause great harm to those who attempt to channel it.
