        These small fae creatures roam the various courts of The Feywild, and seem to be most commonly spotted near
        mountainous areas and cave entrances. Though at a distance they seem to imitate Gnomes, these creatures are
        vastly different and the two should not be confused (calling a Gnome a Hobbie is a terrible insult!)
    </p>
    <p>
        With one leg longer than the other, these creatures perpetually hobble around instead of walk which seems to
        cause them great discomfort and pain. This discomfort will change to rage, however, if they spot another
        creature that is walking without a limp or hobble of their own as they believe such actions are insults directed
        to them specifically and making fun of their inability to walk normally.

        This usually causes them to fight viciously to "right this wrong", attacking their victim's knees and joints in
        an effort to leave them permanently injured and with a limp of their own. In rare cases this rage can cause
        them to kill their victim instead of just disabling them, the bodies mutilated beyond recognition.

        If you encounter a Hobbie, you would do well to give them a wide berth as they often travel in large groups and
        are not afraid to swarm even large parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you cannot avoid them, do your best to imitate a limp and pray they do not see through your acting as their
        rage is drastically amplified on those they discover to be faking, and it is unlikely they will let you escape
        alive!
