excerpt: Tiny golden birds with a penchant for stealing coins, nesting in vaults, and looking adorable. They are a common irritation for rich adventurers.

        These tiny golden birds native to the Feywild are found everywhere commerce is found, from solo market stalls in
        tiny villages to large trade districts in major cities. They adore coins of all kinds and those who are not
        careful around them will find them more than willing to swoop in and steal some right from an unsuspecting
        target's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nobody quite knows why they insist on stealing these coins, though there have been many theories such as that
        they are actually small dragons in disguise trying to build their own hoards. Or that they believe the coins are
        actually their young or their eggs and are returning them to their nests to raise and hatch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others again postulate that these creatures are actually agents of Asmodeus sent to collect tithes of riches to
        their demonic lord in exchange for unlimited power and will one day overthrow the Archfeys and rule the
        Feywilds!

        Regardless of why they do what they do, or indeed where they even come from, one cannot deny there is a certain
        cuteness to their looks and actions, and many adventurers have been duped into taking their eyes off their
        coin-pouches for just long enough to find them suspiciously a few coins lighter.

    <p>
        But just look at the darlings, they wouldn't do that now would they? No surely not, so please, just look at the
        pretty birdy for a moment longer, and ignoring the jingling in your purse.
