excerpt: An unholy fae abomination that parents warn their children about to keep them in line and make them behave. It is just a legend though. Right?

    <p>
        A truly horrifying, multi-limbed abomination of teeth, claws, and terror, it is said no armour can protect from
        its bite. The Schmutz has long been spoken about in stories as a terrifying monster that stalks through The
        Feywild and devours naughty fae children who do not listen to their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is said that a fae child who disrespects their elders, doesn't eat all of their dinner, or cheats at a game
        of tic-tac-toe will be marked by the beast and the next time they go to rest they will be overcome with an
        impossible to ignore desire to wander deep into the forest alone where the creature will rip them limb from limb
        and devour them entirely, leaving nothing behind.
    </p>
    <p>
        The validity of such statements is unknown, but the threat
        alone seems to work well enough as there have been no documented cases of tic-tac-toe cheaters since the stories
        became commonplace.

        Despite the rendition here - which the artist (who wishes to remaining anonymous) insists it is entirely
        correct, citing his own eyes as his primary source - it has been suggested that the Schmutz can also appear as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A 4-armed, 3-legged, towering beast covered in scales
        </li>
        <li>
            An 8-legged, no-armed, 3 foot tall mass of fur with empty sockets where its eyes should be
        </li>
        <li>
            Or a serpentine-bodied, 126-legged mass of shambling sludge covered in innumerable bleeding eyes
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="clear-float"></div>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Regardless, this scholar wishes to assure everyone that this creature is nothing more than a made-up story used
        to scare children into behaving and can no more hurt you than any other nonsensical fairytale!

        Now if you will excuse me, I need to go for a walk into the forest, I feel a strange itching at the back of my
        mind that I cannot quite shake. Good thing I didn't finish my dinner, now I'm not too full to explore.
