        A coalition of adventurers and helpers from all across Navirar, these good-doers stand for freedom and
        self-expression and vehemently oppose all sorts of evil and frequently stand against it at every opportunity.
        From tyrants to evil mages, minor inconvenience to end-of-the-world plots, The Harpers are always seen where
        they are needed most offering a much-needed helping hand to those who need it most.

        Many adventurers join the ranks of The Harpers and every major settlement in Navirar has at least one Harper
        Outpost, a building where fellow Harpers may catch up with each other and share tales of their latest heroic
        deeds. In fact, anyone can join The Harpers, from the simplest farmer to the mightiest warrior, all are welcome
        and respected as equals and will be named an <strong>Associate</strong>, the highest (and only) rank; after all,
        freedom belongs to everyone, so why bother with meaningless titles and advancement?

        As an organisation, they pledge allegiance to Tymora as they believe everyone needs a little luck in their lives
        to help them make the best of a bad situation or capitalize on a good one. It is worth noting however that they
        have no issues with others having different gods or indeed none at all.
