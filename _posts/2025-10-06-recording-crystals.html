        Information is critical to many aspect of life, whether adventuring, exploring, commanding troops in battle, or
        even just remembering what to buy at the markets. However, memories are fallible, notes can struggle to carry
        intonation, and Sending spells are not always readily available. As such, recording crystals were created to
        provide a simple to use, readily available means to consistently relay information across long distances and
        multiple recipients.

        A truly magnificent invention of Wintexia, the utility of this item is undoubtable and has even managed to
        become commonplace in Navirar, a true rarity given the inherent distrust Navirar has in Zyxs' technology. It is
        now produced on both continents with regularity and can be found in all manner of colours, shapes, and sizes
        with some magic shops even offering customised etchings into the crystal itself and voice modulation options
        when a message is recorded.

        With the prevalence of different types and sizes of crystals, and a never-ending desire for new types of
        customisation it is no surprise that some magic artisans have taken to imbuing the recording magic in other
        formats such a coins (colloquially referred to as Whispering Coins), earrings, and even mirrors!

        As the world grows and staying in touch with loved ones becomes harder and harder, the demand for new and
        interesting types of Recording Crystals only continues to grow, as does the creativity of those who make them.
