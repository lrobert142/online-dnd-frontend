title: Names and Their Power
excerpt: Names hold a lot of power, more than some may realise. It is imperative that adventurers understand this and protect themselves against their misuse.

        Words hold power, this much is known by all, it is how spells gain their power, it is how magic is coalesced and
        shaped into its many useful and destructive forms. But not everyone knows that this power also extends to a
        name, and that certain names can carry more power than others especially if used in malicious ways.

    <h2>Given Names</h2>

        That which is given to an individual by others, typically by their parents or guardians when they are born. For
        most people this is the only name they will ever have, and the only one they will ever need.
    </p>
    <p>
        Giving and using a Given Name is usually fine, they are simply a way to refer to others and on the Material
        Plane magic typically has no effect. However, caution must be taken when travelling to other planes as Given
        Names hold significant power and using an entity's Given Name allows one to exert an enhanced level of control
        over individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        From simple trickery and pranks to complete brainwashing and mental domination, a Given Name in the wrong hands
        can spell disaster and is why it is not advised to ever share it with fae, demons, fiends, or the like.

    <h2>Taken Names</h2>
    <img class="float-right no-padding-top no-padding-bottom"

         alt="An anthro raven protected against trickery via a Taken Name"/>
    <p>
        A name that an individual chooses to be identified by, usually a nickname, moniker, or named after a great deed.
        These names protect an individual's Given Name, preventing entities from asserting control over them using it.
        In addition, a Taken Name cannot be used to control another as the power associated with it in internalised
        entirely to the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that this power only works when an individual truly believes in this Taken Name and uses it as their own;
        it does not need to replace their Given Name - and both can even be used interchangeably - but it must act as an
        extension of oneself. Thus, just making up a fake name on the spot will not provide the protection of a Taken
        Name, nor will a nickname given by another (unless they choose to truly embrace it).

    <h2>True Names</h2>
    <img class="float-left no-padding-top no-padding-bottom"
         src="{{ 'assets/img/lore/true-names-true-power.jpeg' | relative_url }}"
         alt="An individual discovering the power of their True Name"/>
    <p>
        Every creature is born with a True Name etched onto their soul that seals their true power. If one could learn
        their True Name and embrace it they would have access to an unfathomable amount of power far beyond what many
        can even comprehend, even the gods would tremble before their might!
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, a True Name is nearly impossible to learn as the means to unlock it is unique to every individual
        and can range from esoteric blood sacrifice rituals and summoning eldritch entities, to dancing naked in a
        temple of Chastity while chugging a bottle of mead on a Thursday at 10:24am. And there is no way to know which
        set of actions will unlock a True Name, not even a Wish can discern all the needed steps.
    </p>
    <p class="addendum">
        There have been rumours of the existence of an excessively powerful artefact from a previous era that contains
        the True Names of all individuals. This has been disregarded by many scholars as nonsense and conjecture.
