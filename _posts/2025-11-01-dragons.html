        If there is one species more well-known, more feared, and more revered than any other in Qeenek it is dragons.
        These magical creatures of incredible ability, wisdom, and cunning are amongst some of the most dangerous and
        powerful creatures this world has to offer. They have long been studied by scholars of all schools of thought
        across both Navirar and Zyxs to try to unravel their mysteries and though much is still unknown progress has
        been made in several areas.

        Magic and Dragons
    </h2>

    <p>
        Dragons are magical creatures, of course, but the exact nature of the magic that makes them up and the abilities
        they wield remains largely in question. Some studies have revealed certain aspects of dragons closely mirror
        Arcane magic with the way they manipulate The Weave, while others have detected trace amount of Divine magic in
        their bodies and breath weapons. Others again have insisted the creatures' closeness with Nature magic hints at
        how they are able to channel such vast quantities of magic without risking mana sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is in this scholar's opinion that dragons are not of a single type of magic, but rather an unusual - and some
        would say, impossible - combination of all three types; Arcane, Divine, and Nature! Indeed, I propose that
        dragons are in fact their own type of magic, able to coerce and control all different types at once in a method
        that is wholly unique to themselves and thus filter it into a new forth type of magic!

        Slaves to Instincts

    <p>
        Despite being creatures of incredible awe and power, dragons seem to struggle greatly with their nature. During
        my travels I was able to interview an adult black dragon who remained nonhostile despite the notoriety of the
        subspecies' propensity for violence. In this interview it explained that each dragon feels a pull to certain
        actions as though instinct guides their thoughts and minds, forcing them to act certain ways or do certain
        things even when they do not want to.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I asked the dragon - who wishes to remain anonymous - to elaborate, it explained that even though it truly
        wished no harm upon me and wanted only to live a peaceful life, it could feel something inside it pushing it
        towards a deep desire to, and I quote, "Rip you limb from limb and dissolve your torso while keeping you just
        alive enough to make you watch." Unfortunately the interview thusly had to be cut short.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless, it is in my opinion that something seems to be making dragons act a certain way; whether instinct,
        magic, godly intervention, or otherwise I cannot say. Further investigation is recommended, although perhaps
        future interviews should be conducted with metallic dragons, just in case instincts cannot be suppressed for the
        entire duration of said interview.

    <h2>
        Types of Dragons
    </h2>
    <h3>Chromatic Dragons</h3>
    <img class="float-left no-padding-top no-padding-bottom"
         src="{{ 'assets/img/lore/chromatic-dragons.jpeg' | relative_url }}"
         alt="A pair of chromatic dragons, itching for a fight">
    <p>
        These dragons are typically the most well known, and not for a good reason. Chromatic dragons are vicious,
        cruel, nasty, and have a very bad superiority complex. Most - though it must be noted, not all - of these kinds
        of dragons view non-dragons as inferior creatures to be controlled, corralled, or hunted for sport. This is
        believed to be due to the fact that they were created by the evil dragon queen, Tiamat, as a plague cast upon
        the world to "cull the weak", although the validity of this statement is currently unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you find yourself coming across a dragon with dull scales of any colour you would do best to give them a wide
        berth, if you value your life. Rarely can they be bargained with, and it is always far more likely that you will
        end up being (at best) the servant of the dragon or a momentary plaything for it. And dragons are unlikely to
        let their servants and playthings leave once they inevitably outlive their usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of the Chromatic dragons, several subspecies are known:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Black - By far the most dangerous kind. Delights in suffering and ruin, seeking to maim and kill all they
            come across. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
        </li>
        <li>
            Blue - Craves controls and hoards followers like others hoard treasure. Can be very convincing, promising
            great power in exchange for loyalty.
        </li>
        <li>
            Green - Manipulators who never fight fair. They are insidious, more likely to rely on trickery and
            misdirection than outright force.
        </li>
        <li>
            Red - Loves to hoard all manner of shiny things, no matter how many they have to kill to steal it from.
            Incredibly vengeful, they will hunt hoard-thieves across even other planes of existence.
        </li>
        <li>
            White - Fiercely protective of their territories, they will stop at nothing to kill anyone they perceive as
            an invader. If you're lucky, they will only extort every last treasure from you instead of killing you.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="clear-float"></div>

    <h3>Metallic Dragons</h3>
    <img class="float-right no-padding-top no-padding-bottom"
         src="{{ 'assets/img/lore/metallic-dragons.jpeg' | relative_url }}"
         alt="A gold dragon practicing magic"/>
    <p>
        Conversely to Chromatic dragons, Metallic dragons are far kinder, preferring to assist non-dragons with
        difficult tasks and indeed have even been known to act as guardians of towns or provide much needed assistance
        to heroes on their quests. These creatures seem to view non-dragons with a mixture of a parent's care for their
        child and an intense curiosity to see what the "short-lived creatures" can do.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is believed - though has never been directly confirmed - that all Metallic dragons are descended from the
        platinum dragon, Bahamut, that their shining scales may be used as guidance against the uncertainty of the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>
        The documented types of metallic dragons are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gold - Powerful, majestic, and wise they stand stalwart against the cruelties of the world and ensure
            evildoers are brought to justice. Typically, the most reclusive types of Metallic dragons it is rare to see
            them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Silver - Regal, kind, and gentle they prefer not to fight unless absolutely necessary. They prefer to offer
            guidance to those in need and are often described as being the most 'motherly'.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bronze - Intensively inquisitive, with an insatiable desire to learn more about non-dragons. Their desire to
            experience all that "mortals" have to offer means they are the most likely type of dragon to take on a
            humanoid form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Copper - Kind-hearted pranksters, jokesters, and lovers of riddles, these dragons can seem abrasive at first
            but mean no ill-will. They adore those who can take a prank them back and form lifelong friendships with
            non-dragons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brass - Extremely talkative about anything and everything. Their minds wander quickly between topics rarely
            allowing others to get a word in. If you should interest in a topic they are knowledgeable about be prepared
            to be inundated with non-stop discussions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="clear-float"></div>

    <h3>Other Types of Dragons</h3>
    <p>
        There have been suggestions that other types of dragons exist, creatures such a Gem dragons. This scholar wishes
        to remind the reader that these claims have never been substantiated and are almost certainly the ravings of the
        uneducated. After all, what's next, a chocolate dragon?!
