        Brewed from the crushed hearts of Embernuts, a rare fruiting nut only found in the tricky sunlit grassland that
        borders the numerous beaches of the Summer Court, it is said to hold a fragment of Dawn itself. Steeped in the
        Moonmilk of the Dairy Fairy (A breed of cows-like creatures with colourful spots, some say it's actually a
        very kinky tribe of Minotaur-like beings, though this has never been confirmed) and aged in crystal balls made
        from red sugar crystals, creating an alcoholic beverage that blurs the lines between a cocktail and a sweet
        cream. Authentically served straight from the brewing ball, it nonetheless retains it's flavours and effects
        after bottling for ease of export.

        As the silky ribbons ripple from the bottle, the scent of roasted almonds and ripe strawberries permeate the
        room, a welcome sign of the celebration having only just begun. It's taste begins soft and sweet, followed by a
        nutty note that paves the way for the radiant chill that shoots through the body. The first gulp is always the
        hardest but once that chill subsides, all that is left is a quickened pulse and a stirred spirit. Those who
        drink it find themselves with a louder laugh, a lighter step, and courage untempered.

        Some say it was brewed to revitalize those who frequent the Summer Court's many beachside parties after hours
        of endless dancing, others say it grants the drinker a sliver of the Summer King's vitality. Although these
        gifts are rarely given freely - as it is followed by a regretful crash - a bottle graced by a Fey's presence
        will instead soothe the aches and pains of a long day.
