        A common drink used in the toast of Joy and Illusion. The nectar of the Solar Bloom (a flower that only opens
        once both the sun and the moon share the same sky - a surprisingly common occurrence in the Autumn Court) is
        gathered by hand from the awakening blossoms, infused with dream pollen taken from the Dream-rose (a pastel
        purple mutation of the Material Plane's common rose) and mixed with the frostbitten dew found on the edges of
        the Autumn and Winter courts, and distilled into this wonderous drink.

        When uncorked, the scent is bright and effervescent; honey, citrus, and something no one can quite place. On the
        tongue, it is sweet and silky, with a fizzling warmth that dances behind the teeth. Drinkers talk about a
        tingling joy that bubbles up from the chest, filling them with inspiration, mischief, and a sudden affection for
        everyone nearby.

        Some say a single glass can let you see the world as they Fey do - vibrant, alive, and ever-shifting - but if
        you laugh too freely while under its spell, you may find your reflection winking back at you long after the
        night has passed.
