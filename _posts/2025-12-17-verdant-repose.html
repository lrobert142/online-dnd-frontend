excerpt: A soft, lively green, reminiscent of moss, with glimmers of a pale jade streaking throughout, curling and fading like a mist.

        Brewed under the quiet canopies of the Spring Court, Verdant Repose is made from Rainleaf buds gathered during a
        misty rainfall, and the sap of the Slumberwillow tree. Steeped in a perfectly clear crystal basin and lined with
        river rocks from Wishful Creek, it is infused with the calming power of a gentle river.

        The Aroma is fresh, and grounding - petrichor and wild mint - the taste carrying a mix of bitterness smooth
        sweetness, like the fresh air after a rainstorm or the first bite of fresh herbs. A soothing wave follows each
        sip that spreads through the chest and shoulders, easing tensions and softening the noise of the mind.

        Travelers whisper that a cup of Verdant Repose can calm even a raging beast or coax a restless spirit into a
        peaceful slumber. Some druids claim it lets one hear the slow heartbeat of the land itself, if they decide to
        listen.
