    A travelling academic who came to Phandalin with her travel companion, Edward Fluffbottom. Unlike her companion who
    prefers to learn about the past, she seeks to chronicle the present and help establish a safe and prosperous future.
    Upop learning of the party's deeds, she requested Gaelin to allow her to build a library to help further her
    studies.
