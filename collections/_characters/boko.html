<p>
    An elderly goblin who has clearly seen decades of hard labour and slavery. Upon being freed from his life of forced
    servitude, he asked to work for Kaldoris in the gardens stating that he wants his twilight years to be spent above
    ground surrounded by nature he never got to experience.

    "I don't want you feeling sorry for me - I had a good enough life, all things considered - but I would love to be
    able to spend some time around flowers and plants before I die. That'd be a nice retirement, I think."
