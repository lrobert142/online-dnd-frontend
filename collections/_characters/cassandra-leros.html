    The second-in-command of the party and the other original party member before Petee departed and Xania perished. She
    is gruff and speaks little, but is actually quite kind, just very unsure how to talk with people and uncomfortable
    in social situations. Being a soul-knife rogue she is very adept at getting what the party needs without drawing
    attention to herself or her party members. She prefers a more hit-and-run technique and is quick to turn tail when
    the odds are not in her favour.

    Most of her time in the party when Petee was still around was spent trying to keep Xania's snide comments and
    pompous remarks in check and provide some form of buffer to his incessant bullying of Petee. She was unfortunately
    only seldom able to draw his attention for long and on more than a few occasions joked to Petee that she could cut
    off on of Xania's toes as a warning if he wanted; her tone suggesting a joke, but her stance indicated more. When
    Petee departed she spent the better part of a day complaining to Marcus, accusing him of not having a backbone and
    being a contributor to why he left.

<p>
    Since then - and especially after Xania's death - she has mellowed out and made amends with Marcus insisting it
    wasn't his fault and fully admitting that the stress had her lashing out. She now wholeheartedly supports Marcus'
    leadership and has his back whenever hard decisions need to be made.
