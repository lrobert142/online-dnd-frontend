    An adorable bundle of energy with an insatiable hunger for knowledge, Edward came to Phandalin in hopes of
    uncovering the location of the Phandelver Mine! Of course, now that it's been found he has turned his attention to
    other things and asked Kaldoris to allow him to build a library in Thunrdertree. He promises to collect knowledge
    from all over and make it worth everyone's while!
