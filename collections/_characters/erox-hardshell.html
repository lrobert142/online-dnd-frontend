<p>
    An elderly Tortle, retired from a life of warfare. He travelled to Phandalin in order escape the hustle and bustle
    of Baldur's Gate, but upon hearing that the Phandelver Mine would be reopening he realised it would come to him. He
    reached out to you offering to build and maintain an Armory for you as long as you promised to keep Thundertree
    somewhat quiet.
