    A hardworking and very pragmatic individual, Ginger spends her days helping around Wolfhaven wherever she can. Be it
    helping to harvest wheat and vegetables, milling grains, or cleaning the inn alongside her beloved soon-to-be-wife
    Mango, she is a common face around town. Everyone knows and respects her greatly and even though she might grumble
    and groan sometimes, she always comes through in the end.

    Many agree that Mango has had a noticeable improvement on her otherwise somewhat pessimistic outlook on life and
    describe them as "soulmates lucky enough to have found each other."

    Though normally not one for pets, Sýnchysi's Fey Blinkhound (Fari) seems to have worked its way into her heart and
    she was more than happy to spend hours of the night playing with him alongside Mango. Despite repeatedly telling
    Mango not to overfeed him, she couldn't bring herself to stop the flow of treats to Fari seeing how happy it made
    him.
