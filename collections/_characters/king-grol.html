<p>
    A grumpy, loud, obnoxious bugbear who is rarely seen without his elderly pet wolf, Snarl. His attitude rarely earns
    him a lot of friends, but his natural leadership and connections to less-than-savoury individuals could prove useful
    in defending Thundertree. Not like he would have given you much of a choice, stating (not asking) that he will set
    up a barracks and stock it with some 'friends' he knows.
