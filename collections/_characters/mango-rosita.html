    An old friend of Petee's who now runs the best - and only - inn in Wolfhaven, she is always one for rumours and
    stories, no matter how absurd or outlandish they are. Though she does have a much better fondness for true stories
    from adventurers and hopes that one day Wolfhaven will grow big enough that adventurers will frequent her inn and
    regale her with wonderful tales. So far it has only been a few travelling merchant.

    She is easy-going, very kind, always sees the good in life no matter how dire a situation seems and refuses to let
    anyone bring the mood down. Her upbeat, persistent optimism and happy-go-luck view on life - and her soothing
    excited chirps - can bring a smile to even the most gruff farmer.

<p>
    She is due to be wed to Ginger Balam soon!

    Upon meeting the party for the first time and giving them food and a room for the night, she encountered Fari -
    Sýnchysi's Fey Blinkhound - and was immediately smitten with how adorable he is and how helpful around the inn he
    is. She spent a good period of time cooing over him and giving him a lot of quite lavish treats, probably more than
    he should have had in one sitting.
