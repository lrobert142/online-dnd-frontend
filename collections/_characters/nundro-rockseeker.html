    Youngest brother of the Rockseekers trio, Nundro is a proud, nervous, and very excitable priest of Labelas Enoreth
    who looks up to his brothers and wishes to use his Divine arts to help them uncover the mysteries of the past.
    Though sometimes a little naive, his overwhelming positivity and care for all those around him is infectious and
    rarely fails to uplift the spirits of those around him.

    His current whereabouts are unknown, though a journal entry from Tharden indicates he might be being held captive in
    Phandelver Mine. Why would he be somewhere like that?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    The party was able to find Nundro locked deep within the mine, hidden in the Black Spider's living quarters. He was
    badly beaten and clearly malnourished, but still alive. However, it seems not all was as simple as it seemed as he
    had been implanted with a spider egg that was about to hatch, surely breaking his ribs and eating its way out of
    him.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, with some quick thinking and deft handiwork, the party was able to slay the creature gestating in his
    chest and prevent it from immediately killing him. However, they were unable to remove the now dead spider corpse
    from his chest and over the course of the several days back he became more and more ill until he was barely clinging
    to life.
</p>
<p>
    Having pushed through with inhuman resilience, he was able to survive long enough to reach Phandalin where the party
    and Sister Garaele were able to swiftly operate on him and save his life. Though still quite ill, he is now
    spider-free and on the road to recovery.

<p>
    The death of his brother, Tharden, and subsequent discovery of his journal has impacted him greatly, and although he
    puts on a brave face it is clear he blames himself for Tharden's death. However, instead of succumbing to despair,
    he has sworn to make his brother's sacrifice count and vowed to take over the mine's day-to-day running in his
    stead. His conviction and devotion to his brother's memory is inspiring.
