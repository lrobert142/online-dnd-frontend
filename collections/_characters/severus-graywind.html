    A simple businessman - and owner of Severus' Supplies - that deals with all manner of adventuring supplies and is
    one of a few that dares to make investments abroad such as helping supply Linene in the new frontier town of
    Phandalin. He and Linene have apparently been business partners for many years.

    Though a very straightforward man with little to say - as he is often caught up in his many business ventures and
    supply runs - don't mistake his quietness for a lack of desire for conversation, he adores hearing tales from
    adventures and their journeys. Especially if the items he sold them came in useful in a pinch.
