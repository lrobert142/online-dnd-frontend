<p>
    A very no-nonsense individual who spends nearly all his time smithing up weapons, armor, and custom orders in his
    smithy: The Hammer and Anvil. He has spent his whole life smithing and is a master craftsman, one of the most
    well-known and respected in all of Andoril. Because of all the stories he’s heard - good, bad and otherwise - he can
    sometimes come off as a little tired or jaded, but he means no harm, he is just so busy and enveloped in his work
    that he rarely makes time for small talk.

<p>
    He has no sons or daughters - nor any desire for them - but hopes to one day take on an apprentice to teach and
    carry on his legacy and forge. Now if only he could make the time to go looking for one instead of smithing more.
    Maybe after the next order? Or the next one. Or the next one. Or...
