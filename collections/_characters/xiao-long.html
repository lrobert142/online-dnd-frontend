    A travelling merchant hailing from the land of Hala'shu (an oddity given the country's notorious dislike for
    frivolous items and decadent trading) he specialises in silks and all manner of high-value items such as tapestries.
    He does not speak much about his past and is quick to redirect any questions about it to other topics, insisting his
    stories of it are dull and would surely send others to sleep.

    Nearly always a happy and excitable individual, he does his best to make light of even the darkest situations and is
    always there with a caring ear and reassuring words. However, when combat breaks out he is quick to run and hide and
    his normally upbeat nature changes to one of worry and fear. He makes no attempt to hide his fear of combat and is
    grateful he has Elana to help defend him and his goods from ne'er-do-wells.

    Joining the party from Phandalin back to Baldur's Gate, he was more than happy to assist the party in bringing
    Linene's caravan back as well and quickly attempted to make friends with the party. Unfortunately the road was not
    as clear as he would have liked and several setbacks raised tensions amongst the group, but nevertheless he tried to
    raise everyone's spirits (with mixed success).

    Finally back in Baldur's Gate, he is now resting for a few days after the stress of his latest adventures before
    deciding where next to pedal his wares.
