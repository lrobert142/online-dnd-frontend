<p>
    A deceptively old raven archmage who looks after the Andoril Mages Guild ensuring experiments are safely contained,
    documented properly, and apprentices don’t have their insides turned into outsides. She herself is an Arcane wizard
    instead of a Divine magic user and has fought hard to have Arcane magic study allowed in Baldur’s Gate, arguing that
    its usefulness can help everyone, regardless of their background. As such, she works hard to ensure the reputation
    of the guild is kept in good standing, and will not tolerate those who besmirch the guild's reputation.

<p>
    Don’t cross her or her guild, she has been known to have a dangerously quick temper, and knows more than a few ways
    to skin a humanoid.
