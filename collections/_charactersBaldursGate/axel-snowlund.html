<p>
    A laid-back individual with a heavy southern drawl that often catches people out given the notoriety snow leopards
    have for soft soothing accents. He has known Baldur’s Gate his entire life, and his easygoing, gentle appearance as
    well as being the innkeep/bartender of the largest and most well established adventure's inn in town - The Spotted
    Paw Inn - leads to him hearing a lot of rumours and learning more than many will ever know. This has also led to
    him having a very open mindset, and he does not even so much as baulk at all the many strange and wonderful
    creatures adventures bring into his inn, nor does he worry about what might happen behind closed doors (he provides
    sound-dampening rooms for a reason~)

    A sucker for a good story or a great songs sung by a bard, regaling him with thrilling tales of battles and great
    discoveries is the quickest way to his already wide-open, lovable heart.
