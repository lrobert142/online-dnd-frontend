<p>
    A rough, dirty-looking pixie with a more-than-questionable set of morals who owns The Leaky Tap brewery in Baldur's
    Gate. While not the biggest brewery around, it is renowned as being one of the few to work with Feywild drinks such
    as the infamous Midnight's Embrace. Of course, this curious selection of drinks has also made it highly regulated
    and these products can only be sold to specific businesses. Although, with the right words and enough coins
    sometimes bottles can <span class="italic">mysteriously</span> go missing.
