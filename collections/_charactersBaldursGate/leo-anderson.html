<p>
    The hardworking Guildmaster of the Andoril Fighter's Guild, he is a kind but firm individual who manages the guild
    by ensuring jobs are accepted with enough information, organising supplies for new adventurers, and generally
    ensuring the day-to-day running of the place goes without issue. He rarely interacts with individuals - preferring
    to delegate to those under him - but can nearly always be found in the Guildermaster's office, pouring over
    paperwork and managing resource requisitions.

    There is only one thing that seems to upset Leo: his name. He is very conscious of his name meaning lion and will
    snap at anyone that tries to make fun of it.
