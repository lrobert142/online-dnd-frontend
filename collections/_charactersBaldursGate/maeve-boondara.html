    The long-time owner of The Jewel of Baldur’s Gate and an expert of gems of all kinds, Maeve is an elderly and quiet
    individual who spends her time creating wonderful pieces of wearable art. She is widely renowned for being able to
    work with gems in a way that can make even dwarves enviously, yet is also very humble and easy to get along with,
    insisting that her talents are "something anyone can develop, with enough practice." Her very kind demeanour and
    gentle nature makes people swiftly warm up to her, and her competitive prices ensure customers keep coming back.
