    A quiet, kind, slightly lacking in self-confidence Divine Soul Sorcerer who now acts as the leader of the party
    after Petee’s departure and Xania’s death. He prefers to avoid confrontation and tries to quickly resolve any
    arguments or disagreements between people. Although he prefers to talk his way out of situations, if push does come
    to shove, and he has to fight, he prefers to stay on the backlines acting as crowd control and support instead of
    outright damage, although he isn’t afraid to do harm if he needs to.

    His time spent with Petee was brief, but he greatly respected him and hoped to forge a strong and lasting friendship
    with him, hoping they would all adventure together for many years. Unfortunately, when Xania started harassing Petee
    his inability to handle social conflicts lead to him remaining silent and ultimately lead to the group disbanding.
    Even now it haunts Marcus, and he hopes to one day make it up to Petee and hopefully reform their strained
    friendship.
