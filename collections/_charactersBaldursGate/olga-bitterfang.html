<p>
    Owner of the Stitches And Glitz clothier/tailor/dyeing shop (a relatively small store of barely 3 years), Olga is a
    very rare case of a Gnoll that has broken free from the ever-maddening voice of Yeenoghu and chosen a quiet retreat
    away from the violence her species is typically known for.
</p>
<p>
    She also has a reputation for working on more esoteric fabrics that many other clothiers simply will not touch -
    such as Demonspindle and Spidersilk, to name a few. She adores making beautiful things and is willing to go above
    and beyond for people that bring her unique or different items and fabric to work with.
</p>
<p>
    Olga also owns a male hyena as a pet - named Lancelot - who she saved from her tribe when she was freed from the
    Gnoll curse and fled her previous life. She seems to share a very deep bond with him and loves him dearly.
