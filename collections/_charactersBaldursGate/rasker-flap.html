    Rasker is a very strange birdfolk who adores experimenting with all kinds of alchemical reagents, strange chemical
    reactions, and developing unique potions of questionable usefulness. As the owner of The Caw-ldron, he will gladly
    buy anything adventurer’s find that might be useful in a potion, even if it’s likely to result in an inert or
    otherwise useless (or rarely, harmful) brew. This is because he adores experimentation and does not see failure as a
    bad thing, but as a means to success:

<blockquote>
    “I didn’t fail, I succeeded in learning a new way not to make it work!”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Despite his unkempt looks and eccentric demeanour, he is quite harmless and simply enjoys life to the best of his
    ability. Besides, his normal run-of-the-mill potions are actually quite useful and cost-effective, and many
    adventurers owe their lives to his well-made Healing Potions; they even taste a little fruity!
