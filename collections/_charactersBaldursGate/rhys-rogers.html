    Elected leader of the Lord’s Alliance, Rhys is an older man and retired military general that served for many
    decades and had even led several successful military movements against enemies of Andoril. Widely respected by not
    only his peers, but also by the kind and queen, and much beloved by the public. He proudly displays the many medals
    he had earned during his time in the military and is rarely seen without them.

    With a very sharp attitude, he often cuts the fat from conversations, which can make him seem aggressive and
    forceful, as he sees no use for frivolous words and wasted time. His blunt and forward approach had served him well
    in the military, and he never quite shook that habit. He despises being challenged or having his authority
    questioned, viewing it as insubordination.
