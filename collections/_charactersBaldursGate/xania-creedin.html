    Arrogant, narcissistic, and unbearable to be around, he believes his magical prowess as an Evocation Wizard and
    affluent family in Zyxs makes him the best of the best. In reality, he has little skill and mostly relied on luck to
    get to where he is today. He absolutely hates those without magic viewing them as simple barbarians who are only
    “waving sticks around”. This simplemindedness made him frequently butt heads with Petee and resulted in frequent
    bullying and snide remarks about Petee's "lack of magic and skill".

    Despite repeated attempts by Cassandra to stop his harassment, he ignored her insisting that, "we magic users have
    to stick together, not defend stupid half-breeds that can only run around stabbing things like simpletons." He knew
    he was not well liked. He didn't care.

    After Petee's departure, he insisted the remaining members take a high-level job to clear out a pack of gnolls from
    a nearby forest to, "show that bird how much better we are now that he's not holding us back." Unfortunately, the
    party was ambushed by a scouting gnoll party and instead of running he brandished his magic in an attempt to scare
    them away, but all it did was make them angry and mark him as a high priority target. He was promptly pinned down,
    ripped apart, and eaten. An empty grave in Baldur’s Gate is all that remains, along with others’ memories of him.

    Nobody in the party seems particularly upset at his death.
