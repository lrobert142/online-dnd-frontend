<p>
    A respectful, kindly gentleman who maintains the Baldur's Gate Harper’s Hall and ensures everyone who resides in it
    is looked after. As the chief custodian, he is also responsible for ensuring everything is well stocked, keeping the
    peace, and making sure people don’t overstay their welcome. He isn't particularly fond of listening to the stories
    of adventurers - given how many he's already heard, and how many are drastically exaggerated - but is kind enough to
    pretend to listen anyway.

    Apparently he is quite the dangerous swordsman, although his natural charisma is able to disarm nearly any situation
    meaning he rarely resorts to violence so nobody can confirm this.
