    Though a devout priestess of Waukeen, she believes in supporting all kinds of religious beliefs and helping guide
    others through difficult times. Upon hearing that the party was planning to establish roots in Thundertree, she
    asked Gaelin to be allowed to establish a place of worship there to give others hope in times of need.
