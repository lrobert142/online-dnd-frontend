    A young goblin lady who claims to have been a quite successful tinkerer before she was captured and enslaved. After
    being freed by the party from her forced servitude she was incredibly thankful and has promised to build and run a
    workshop for Sýnc to use in Thundertree (and also use it herself to keep tinkering).
