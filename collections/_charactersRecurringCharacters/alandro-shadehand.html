    Dangerous, mysterious, ruthlessly efficient, sadistic. These are only a few of the words that can be used to
    describe the master assassin that is Alandro. And he revels in them.
</p>
<p>
    A killer since birth, he was raised by the Shadehand Clan in the ways of stealth, subterfuge, and murder from the
    moment he could wield a blade and took to his grim assignments with a devotion and exhilaration that cannot properly
    be put into words. He seems to be particularly fond of poisons and disguises and is not afraid to utilise even the
    most 'cowardly' of tactics if it means getting close enough to his targets to take them out; even willing to
    disguise himself as loved ones of his target so he can get close enough to run his blade across their throat.
</p>
<p>
    The blade he wields is enchanted to prevent the scars it leaves from ever healing properly even when cured with
    magic or powerful potions. Additionally, the poisons he uses seem to be custom-made variants of other widely known
    poisons, being much more potent and able to combine multiple effects - such as paralysis and blindness - although
    how this is achieved is as-of-yet unknown.
</p>
<p>
    The only constant known to his mannerisms and disguises is that he is left-handed, a somewhat rarity in the world.
