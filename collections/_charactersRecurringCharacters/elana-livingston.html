    An adventurer from a small village who has taken up protecting caravans and travelling merchants. She is currently
    under the employ of Xiao Long and ensures he and his goods make it to cities unharmed.
</p>
<p>
    She doesn't speak much about herself, her past, or her hometown preferring to maintain a certain level of distant
    professionalism while on jobs. But don't take her quietness for rudeness, she just takes a while to warm up to
    people and doesn't enjoy talking unless there's something to be said. She also likes hearing tales from other
    adventurers more than speaking about her own relatively mundane life.

    Being raised in a small village with small world views and very enforced beliefs, when she learned of Sýnc's
    proclivities she reacted with disgust and anger out of habit instead of logic which put a gap between her and the
    party. Additionally, an assassin by the name of Alandro disguised themselves as her and attempted to ambush the
    party, further leading to distrust and agitation.
</p>
<p>
    However, after a long discussion and seeing firsthand the love, trust, and care shared by not just Sýnc but the
    entire party she was forced to face her inner prejudices and came to the bitter conclusion that what she believed
    may not be all there is to know about the subject. Though confused, she worked to repair the damage done by her
    earlier comment and promised the party to remain more open to different viewpoints in the future. Hopefully she can
    keep her promise.

    Back in Baldur's Gate, she is relaxing for a few days to gather her strength before heading back out on the road
    with Xiao, no doubt to new and interesting places.
