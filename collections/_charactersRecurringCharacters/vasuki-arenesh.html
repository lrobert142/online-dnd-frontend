<p>
    A mysterious naga who proclaims to be a powerful enchanter and runs the very unusual store called The Snake Oil
    Emporium; a shop which exists entirely inside a demiplane and is accessed only through an unusual golden-snake
    door that appears to show up at random (and disappear just as quickly).
</p>
<p>
    His love of pranks and tricks is evident in the many seemingly pointless enchanted items he makes and sells; from
    some that sound useful but do nothing, to those that sound useless and very much are. Indeed, many who enter his
    store do so with the sole idea of purchasing his goods to prank their friends and family. However, he does also have
    a smaller selection of useful goods and has been known to create custom powerful enchantments. When the mood strikes
    him.
</p>
<p>
    Aside from his love of pranks, he has a reputation for being an enormous flirt, knowing exactly how to make groups
    flustered and hot under the collar without making them uncomfortable. Be wary of flirting back with this serpent, he
    will see it as a challenge and flirt back even harder until you either yield, or end up in his bedroom.

<p>
    An eldritch being from far beyond even the outer planes, his size is enormous; easily enough to coil around the
    entirety of The Snake Oil Emporium’s demiplane, and in fact it is his body that gives the outside its constant
    space-like view instead of the normally empty black abyss.
</p>
<p>
    Able to shift sizes at will - from enormous beyond imagining to small enough to fit in your palm - and possessing a
    hypnotic gaze and scale-reverberations that can cause even the strongest willed individuals to walk willingly into
    his immense, crushing coils, he helps Vasuki prevent would-be thieves from stealing from the shop. And punishes
    those silly enough to persist after their first, and only, warning.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully he is quite well-mannered, and does not misuse this power, and also respects Vasuki enough to defer to
    him when a situation needs to be de-escalated and his intervention is not needed.
