<p>
    A mysterious naga who proclaims to be a powerful enchanter and runs the very unusual store called The Snake Oil
    Emporium; a shop which exists entirely inside a demiplane and is accessed only through an unusual golden-snake
    door that appears to show up at random (and disappear just as quickly).
</p>
<p>
    His love of pranks and tricks is evident in the many seemingly pointless enchanted items he makes and sells; from
    some that sound useful but do nothing, to those that sound useless and very much are. Indeed, many who enter his
    store do so with the sole idea of purchasing his goods to prank their friends and family. However, he does also have
    a smaller selection of useful goods and has been known to create custom powerful enchantments. When the mood strikes
    him.
</p>
<p>
    Aside from his love of pranks, he has a reputation for being an enormous flirt, knowing exactly how to make groups
    flustered and hot under the collar without making them uncomfortable. Be wary of flirting back with this serpent, he
    will see it as a challenge and flirt back even harder until you either yield, or end up in his bedroom.

    The party purchased a small selection of items from him for very cheap - including the Boots of Water Trekking and
    Ring of Detecting Magic - along with various magic potions, only to discover they did not do what they wanted them
    to do! Incensed and feeling cheated, the party confronted the naga when his door next showed up near their camp
    (which Vasuki insists was just to hand them some items, and definitely not because he is following them) only to be
    told that at no point had he lied to them; had they asked he would have told them the items were pranks.
</p>
<p>
    Though upset, the party was able to ask if he might be able to create actually useful items for them in the future,
    which he begrudgingly said he would consider, depending on what it was and his mood at the time. Perhaps there he
    can be useful after all?
