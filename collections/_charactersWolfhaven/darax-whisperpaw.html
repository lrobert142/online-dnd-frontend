    One of the younger members of the pack at only 253 years of age, he prefers to spend most of his time in his
    quadrupedal wolf form swimming and playing with the various bones left behind after the pack's meals. Ever impulsive
    and aloof, he tends to speak before thinking which has seldom gotten him in trouble with Vargus. Still, his actions
    are never intended to cause irritation, and he makes up for it with his intense loyalty and unnatural stealth, being
    one of their most talented and effective scouts despite outward appearances.

    Though always eager for a good roll in the hay - even with those outside the pack, provided they are trusted by
    Vargus - he is no fool and knows better than to gift the Blessing to anyone else. As such, despite his casual
    attitude he is incredibly responsible. When he needs to be.

    During the party's venture to the lycanthrope's den, his eye seemed particularly drawn to Sýnchysi, though the exact
    reasons were unknown. Perhaps he admires someone as tall as he is or the scent of the Feywilds?
