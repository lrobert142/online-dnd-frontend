<p>
    A quiet and stoic retired adventurer who is never seen without his wolf companion, Wolp. His keen eyes, firm but
    fair attitude, and solid sense of right and wrong have lead to him being the one many people look up to when
    in times of need.
</p>
<p>
    After retiring from adventuring to settle down to a quiet life and return to his farming roots, he set up a
    small home in the forest to enjoy his retirement in peace. However, over time people began to join him and
    eventually he established a small village called Wolfhaven which he acts as the mayor for.
</p>
<p>
    He has one son - Petee McBuggins - whom he cares for deeply.
</p>
<p>
    Strangely enough nobody has ever seen him with the mother - or any woman for that matter - and Pete himself refuses
    to answer any questions about the topic.

    Upon his son returning to the village, Pete was made aware of the lycanthropes guarding Wolfhaven and his son's many
    victories and incredible stories. He is happy to see his son not only doing so well, but also enjoying his life of
    adventuring and being with a such an amazing and capable group; allaying many of his worries. Though he wouldn't
    mind Petee coming back to visit again sometime.
</p>
<p>
    During this visit, Pete and Petee also had a deep heart-to-heart discussion about his mother, though exact details
    seem to be a secret to everyone else. What could they have talked about?
