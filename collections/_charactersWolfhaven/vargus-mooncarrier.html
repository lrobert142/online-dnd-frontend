<p>
    Leader of a group of lycanthropes, Vargus and his pack have been silent protectors of Wolfhaven since it's very
    inception as Pete's single home in the forest. Allegedly by mistake at first - he was not aware of Pete's desire to
    settle nearby - he has since taken it upon himself to ensure the town is kept free of less-than-savoury-individuals
    in order to pay back Pete's kindness from long ago. Though the exact details leading to this repayment are currently
    unknown, they clearly hold a very important place in Vargus' heart.
</p>
<p>
    As the pack's leader, all other look to him for guidance and delegation of duties which he takes in stride with
    practiced ease and calm confidence. Though it can sometimes be difficult - especially having to keep existence of
    his pack hidden from the public - he continues to push forward with the grace and wisdom of someone far beyond his
    years. His pack is eternally grateful for his kind, focused, and peerless leadership and many openly support him as
    one of the best leaders the pack has ever had.
</p>
<p>
    Pretty much the only thing that seems to bother him is when he is misidentified as a werewolf instead of a
    lycanthrope. He insists the two carry very different meanings and that his pack "is not monstrous savages".

    Upon encountering the party camped out on their way to Wolfhaven, Vargus recognised Petee from when he encountered
    him as a small child and lead him back to Wolfhaven, and called off what would have been a vicious attack by his
    other packmates. He explained he mistook them for cultists that had been roaming the nearby area causing havoc in
    neighbouring villages. Thankfully now that he knows they are here, he promises no harm will come to any of them.

    Meeting with the party - and Pete, much to Vargus' surprise - at the pack's den, he revealed a tattered fragment of
    cloth from one of the cultists they had dealt with, which Pete was able to identify as belonging to very bad people.
    Though he would not go to the town itself - citing fear of public knowledge of his kin, and potential huntings - he
    did promise to keep a closer eye on the town's surroundings to try and prevent these cultists from attacking the
    town directly.
