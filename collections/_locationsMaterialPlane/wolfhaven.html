    A tiny and quiet village that was established by a retired adventurer - Pete "Peet" McBuggins - nearly
    30 years ago when he stepped away from his duties to settle back into a simple lifestyle. Though originally
    just one house and a simple field, its proximity to the Andoril-Malgalus trade route eventually led to more
    people setting up in the area until it became the small village it is today.

<p>
    Growing a small variety of hardy vegetables and grains, and hunting the plentiful animals in the surrounding
    forests, the village is entirely self-sufficient though does sometimes trade with passing caravans to obtain more
    exotic or difficult-to-make goods.
</p>
<p>
    They seem to prefer hunting alongside animals, particularly wolves and other canines.

    Upon camping in the forest nearby Wolfhaven they learned of a pack of lycanthropes nearby. However, they were not
    hostile and instead seemed to be safeguarding the village from evildoers, including cultists that had been attacking
    other nearby villages and now seemed to be trying to attack Wolfhaven itself.
