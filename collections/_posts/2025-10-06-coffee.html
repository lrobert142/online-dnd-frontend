excerpt: A very curious bean that is difficult to cultivate but has many wonderful and sought after benefits. Just don't drink too much of it.

        A truly wonderous bean that, when prepared properly, can be infused in hot water to produce a delightfully warm
        and invigorating drink. Its ability to provide those who consume it with extra energy, sharpness of mind, and
        extra focus is renowned across all of Qeenek. However, it is also known to cause jitteriness and anxiety if
        consumed in large doses.

        The specifics of cultivating these plants is a closely guarded secret and only residents of Dalortha are known
        to be able to consistently grow it in any meaningful quantity. This difficulty in growing it combined with its
        many well-sought after properties (and perhaps moderately addictive qualities) results in it being considered a
        luxury item. Indeed, the further abroad one goes from Dalortha the more expensive it is likely to be, something
        many merchants are more than happy to cash in on.

        Some coffee artisans have taken to combining the dark brew with other items such as milk and cream, and even
        sugar to reduce the inherent bitterness of the drink. Others again have begun to experiment with what they call
        "coffee art", a strange and elegant practice that makes foam shapes on top of the drink.

        Delicious and pretty to look at, how delightful!
