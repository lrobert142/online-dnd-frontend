title: The Flufflebrush
excerpt: A very strange brush that works perfectly on both fur and feathers, but only if you have both, otherwise it's just painful and irritating.

        Created by Vasuki, this very unusual brush is a one-of-a-kind item that claims to be able to brush both fur and
        preen feathers (instead of requiring separate brushes) delivering a wonderfully relaxing sensation that puts the
        brushed into a state of intense blissful euphoria, nigh unexplainable in words alone.

        However, the brush only seems to work on those with both fur and feathers alike as when used by only those with
        fur the finer bristles retract leaving only the feather-preening bristles behind, and likewise the opposite when
        one with only feathers uses it. This has thus far rendered it completely useless to any who have wished to use
        it - indeed it often leaves them in quite a bit of pain as it tears out fur and feathers alike - and thus it has
        never left the store.

        If someone could find an individual with both fur and feathers - and someone not the size of a gryphon as the
        brush is far too small to get through the thick coats adorning their larger frames - then maybe, just maybe, it
        could be of use to someone. Although, what are the chances of something like that happening?
