        Originally established in the year of 5,238ATS, The Adventure's Guild is a very unusual guild that offers help
        and assistance to all, regardless of continental or planar loyalties. The Guild itself owes loyalty to no set
        region, plane, or political alliance. Instead, they freely travel throughout the various planes of existence
        via teleportation magic to and from their extradimensional guildhall, solving problems that many do not even
        find out about until long after the threat has been resolved.

        Finding and entering the guild itself is impossible - the magical sigils and safeguards surrounding it protect
        it from even the most powerful of magic - however the guild does have contact outposts at every capital city in
        Qeenek and at key locations in the non-material planes. One simply needs to speak to the administrator's
        projection at any location and your message will be passed on instantaneously! Do note however that some
        locations do not have these outposts due to magical interference or other complexities; Draconis, for example,
        does not have an outpost due to unknown agreements between the guild and the Five Emperors.

        It is said that nobody asks to join The Adventure's Guild, instead they reach out to individuals of exceptional
        heroism to offer them these most prestigious positions. So be not disheartened if you do not hear from them
        directly and instead direct your focus towards the greater good and assisting those in need, your actions might
        just spark their interest.
