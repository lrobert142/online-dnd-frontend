<p>
    Watched over by Archfey Leif, the Autumn Court strikes the perfect balance between the harshness of Summer and the
    bitter cold of Winter while providing the calming transitionary feeling of change. The falling leaves never seem to
    run out no matter how long a tree drops them, much to the chagrin of those who call this land their home.

    The residents of this land are quiet and determined, always seeking new and interesting things to gather as though
    eternally preparing for a winter that will never come. Still, at least the squirrels aren't too vicious. Usually.
