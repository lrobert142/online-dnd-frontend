    Ever-prosperous. Beautiful beyond measure. Filled with the sweet scents of innumerable flowers. These are only a few
    of the phrases that could be used to describe the Court of Nature and yet even then it would fail to capture the
    true magnificence of this aspect of the Feywild. Truly the only thing more beautiful than the Court is the stunning
    sight of its ruler, Lady Primrose!

    Aside from its beauty and flowers that line nearly every inch of the palace grounds, this Court is renowned for its
    incredibly fertile land which enables all manner of vegetation to stop by and eat their fill to grow into truly
    magnificent and delicious ingredients. Once they have permission from Our Great Lady of course, for none may take
    without permission unless they wish to join the flowers on her grounds.

    ... How else did you think the flowers got their names?
