snippet: "A very rare hybrid plane that combines Conflict and Creation. Invented by Archfey Albers."
type: "Archfey Court"
---
<p>
    An exceptionally rare court that merges the ideas of Conflict and Creation to not just create new concepts, but
    establish reason and understanding in what they are and how they can be used to make actual items.
</p>
<p>
    Slower than the Court of Creation, but far more carefully thought through than the sudden impulses of Conflict, this
    court thrives on new ideas, knowledge sharing, and a willingness to try new things and fail. And there is a lot of
    failure, for invention necessitates constant trial-and-error!
