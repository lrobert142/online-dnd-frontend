    Despite the name, the Fields of Conflict is not a place of murder or death, instead the residents of this land sort
    out their disputes like reasonable individuals: by holding debates, playing war-games, or stabbing each other in the
    face. Only when they disagree with each other, of course, they're not savages!

    The strange magic that permeates this area means injuries are short-lived and even normally fatal strikes do little
    but bruise the ego of the loser. Which can sometimes be a fate far worse than death. Perhaps conflict is not quite
    so black and white?
