<p>
    One of the more strange and esoteric places in the Feywild, this land is home to many who wish to breathe life into
    new ideas, stories, and creations. It houses all manner of eccentric guests who happily compete with each other to
    develop increasingly absurd and fantastical inventions.

    Unfortunately, experimentation and creation is far more exciting than document writing and record keeping, so don't
    be surprised if you stumble across something that nobody remembers or that everyone has completely forgotten about.
    After all, that was already created so it's boring now; who in their right mind would want to learn about things
    that already exists when you could create a new one!
