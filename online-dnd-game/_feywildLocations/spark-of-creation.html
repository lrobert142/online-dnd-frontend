<p>
    One of the more strange and esoteric places in the Feywild, this land is home to many who wish to breathe life into
    new ideas, stories, and theories. It houses all manner of eccentric guests who happily compete with each other to
    develop increasingly absurd and fantastical concepts, and it is not uncommon to find them debating the finer details
    directly with Archfey Eureka.

<p>
    Unfortunately, theorising creation is far more exciting than actually making it, so don't expect to find things
    actually being made in this land. After all, thoughts are far more interesting than working out the boring details
    of how a thing will work in reality, or how to stop it devouring all life in the known - and unknown - universe.
