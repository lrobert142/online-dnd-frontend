<p>
    A land of overgrown foliage, innumerable animals, and gentle sunshine fills all who reside in the Spring Court with
    a sense of closeness to nature that is incomparable to nearly anywhere else. Under Archfey Gaia's gentle gaze all
    who reside in this court are blessed with a bounty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and prey to hunt.

    Don't worry, the animals frequently repopulate the court, perhaps a side effect of always being in Spring? Mayhaps
    bring some "protection" though, the effects have been known to occasionally affect more than just the animals.
