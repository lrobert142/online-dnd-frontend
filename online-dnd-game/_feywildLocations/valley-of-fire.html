    A land of perpetual fire where the heat never dies down and lava never cools, it contains wandering fortresses and
    towers that traverse the quite dangerous landscape allowing travel in relative safety. Just don't be in a rush, the
    towers get thirsty quickly and often need to take breaks at lava pools; hydration is key!

    Despite the association of fire with Hell, it is important to note that the land here does not smell like brimstone
    or sulphur! Those are revolting and no reasonable archfey would enjoy that. It smells like roast beef instead.

    ... Why a valley of all things? Well heat rises, as we all know, and that means it must get very tired being so high
    up all the time and need somewhere to lie down. Simply logical, of course!
