<p>
    A small cave system inhabited by numerous goblins, it is used as an outpost, hideout, and location to set
    store the ill-gotten gains the goblins 'obtain' from their many raids. Being very crudely furnished, simple
    in design, and rudimentary in most regards it is likely this cave was simply found rather than made.

    Despite the numerous goblins and other creatures that took upn refuge in this cave, the party was able to
    infiltrate it, take care of the inhabitants, and remove the stain of goblin filth for good. It now sits as
    an empty reminder of what happens to those who harm others.
