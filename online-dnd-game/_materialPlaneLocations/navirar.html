    A religious continent with a rich history steeped in Godly interactions and worship, citizens of Navirar are deeply
    entwined with the Divine, whether in worship, prayer, or simple acknowledgement of powers beyond this world.
    Devotion is not a necessity though and even those without strong beliefs are treated fairly. Each country typically
    follows a Chief Deity which has guided the beliefs of their people for millenia and which many do their best to
    embody in their everyday life.

    While Arcane magic is commonplace, some schools of spells are met with distaste or suspicion, particularly those who
    interfere with the cycle of life and death. Those who practice Arcane magic are often watched warily by those with
    Divine magic due to old scars of past interactions with Zyxs, though it is unlikely any actions will be taken unless
    they have reason to suspect an individual.
