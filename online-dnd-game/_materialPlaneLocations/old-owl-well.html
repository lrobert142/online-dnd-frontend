    Once a solid watchtower and minor place of rest for weary travellers in ages long past, it is now nothing
    more than a few crumbling walls and the broken stump of a tower. The only remaining buildings are rotted and
    destroyed, the well a shoddy shadow of what must have once been a well-kept area. Oh how cruel time can be!`

    This area was once home to a powerful Diviner named Agatha who cared deeply for the area and is said to have
    stayed to the bitter end even when she foresaw her own death at the hands of the raiders that pillaged the area.
    It is said that even now her spirit clings desperately to it, though why is unknown.

    Thanks to the party's investigation they were able to put a stop to a necromancer and his fetid minions, as
    well as soothe the spirit of Agatha who thanked them for their help before returning to her well. Now the
    watchtower is once again silent.
