    Hundreds of years ago, this was a thriving town that hosted all manner of miners, villagers, traders and
    more who worked alongside others in the Phandelver Mine. However, an orc raid completely razed the town as
    well as the mine and all settlements around it, leaving nothing but ruins and fire. With the location of the
    mine lost and death at every turn, the town was abandoned for centuries and all but forgotten.

    With the supposed recent discovery of a map leading to the long-forgotten Phandelver Mine a new town has been
    built over the top of the old one by those hopeful to uncover wealth in the area.

    As a frontier town it is no stranger to its fair share of issues and had to contend with an unsavoury groups
    of bandits called Redbrands causing chaos. Until the party stepped in and put a stop to their cowardly acts,
    freeing the town from oppression and bringing joy to the townsfolk.
