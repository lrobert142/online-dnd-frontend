<p>
    Without a doubt the richest city in Navirar and capital of the country of Tsendoric, it is a city favoured
    by merchants, traders, and all who wish to embrace Waukeen's blessings of coin. The architecture of each
    building is intricate, opulently decorated, exceedingly comfortable, and rich beyond compare to any other town.
</p>
<p>
    Ruled by a collection of elected individuals known as the High Council - many of which are officially and
    openly associated with the Cult of Coin - this council of five works together to ensure the best for the town
    and all who reside within it as well as creating new and maintaining existing trade agreements throughout Navirar
    and beyond.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the excess of coin that each building and individual exudes, the town also looks after the less fortunate
    with many simple - but still quite beautiful - sharehouses provided to their residents for free and also have
    many soup kitchens and medicine houses run by the Cult of Coin to ensure nobody goes without proper care. It
    is the only known town or city with a consistent 0% homeless rate.
</p>
<p>
    Any who visit this city would do well to stop by the Grand Temple of Waukeen to talk with the numerous Cult
    of Coin priests and be blessed with good fortune on your journey. Who knows, with any luck you might even be
    fortunate enough to meet with High Councilwoman - and High Priestess - Saren Goldblood herself!
