    Previously the cellar and connected crypt of Tresendar Manor before its fall to ruins, it has since been
    expanded out in various areas allowing quicker access to some rooms and easier traversal by the brigands. The
    digging also opened a crevice into the earth that housed a dangerous creature, be wary of where you step.

    The Redbrands' secret base was evidently not secret enough as the party was able to successful infiltrate it,
    deal with the cowardly brigands, and capture Iarno thus putting an end to the wizard's plans and leaving the
    hideout devoid of evil.
