<p>
    Foul-mouthed, foul-tempered, and willing to look the other way for the right amount of coin, Grista owns
    and runs the Sleeping Giant bunkhouse; a dingy place that only sees questionable clientele.

    She cares little for what happens in Phandalin, and even less for what happens in the outside world, unless
    it can bring her coin.
