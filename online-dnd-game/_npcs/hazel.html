    "She's got talent for sure, I'd wager she'd even give a dwarven smith a run for his coin!" - Sildar, about Hazel's
    skill.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Often absorbed entirely in smithing projects - from swords and armor, to nails and horseshoes - Hazel is the
    town's sole blacksmith. She frequently works masterpieces from even the comparably low-quality metal imported
    from out of town.

<p>
    Though her expressions are often difficult to read and her words often brief and blunt, the fact that she
    stops her smithing entirely to talk with the party speaks loud about her thoughts about them.
