    Large, strong, and dumber than a box of rocks, Klarg leads the Goblins of Cragmaw Hideout through fear and
    intimidation. His word is absolute and his axe is sharp enough to cut down any who would question his rule,
    best to just stay out of his way.

    Betrayed by Yeemik and his once-abused wolf, Ripper, the party was able to instigate a rebellion that lead
    to the tyrant being cut down where he stood. All that strength matters little now.
