<p>
    A beautiful, intelligent, and incredibly brutal archfey, she commands dominion over nature in the feywilds. No
    flowers bloom without her permission, no trees dare take root until she commands them to.
</p>
<p>
    Fascinated with the material plane, she is known to engage with mortals far more frequently than most archfey.
    If you find yourself in her sights you would do well to run and hide, or be ready to entertain a fey, lest
    she introduce you to her flowerbeds.
