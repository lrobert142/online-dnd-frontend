    A free-spirited, kind, and very talented member of the Adventurer's Guild, Naomi specialises in reconnaissance,
    scouting, and data gathering providing invaluable information the Guild can use to ensure their operations are
    successful and other adventures are not going into danger blind.

    Called in as a favour by Sildar, she is happy to help the party track down the mysterious Black Spider and
    ensure that whatever evil they are planning is thwarted before it can start.
</p>
<p>
    She seems to know Petee and his father - Peet - though exact details are largely unknown at this time.

    After being given a very powerful - and very dangerous - artefact from the party, she returned to the Adventurer's
    Guild to ensure it can be safely stored away.
