    "Why sell the produce, when you can make more coin selling the ones who harvest it?" - A quote from Saren,
    said in secret during one of the Cult of Coin's annual celebrations (citation needed)
</blockquote>
<p>
    The leader of the Cult of Coin that inhabits the coast near Phandalin, she embodies the darker side
    of Waukeen, willing to do anything to make an extra coin. Though cunning and manipulative, she has been known
    to treat those who can benefit her with kindness and look after them as though they were her own children.
    Until they outlive their usefulness.

    The party was able to cut her down in Thunrdertree, only for her to melt into slush and be revealed as a
    double! An ominous warning with Saren's voice filled the silence of their victory, promising terrible
    retribution. Just what was she planning?
