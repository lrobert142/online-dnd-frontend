    Dependable, kindly, and helpful whenever and wherever and to whomever he can be, Sildar upholds his oath as
    a knight of the Lord's Alliance with every action and interaction.
</p>
<p>
    Though a skilled swordsman in his own right, his natural charisma and expertise in planning and numerous
    connections often result in him often staying behind to work out the 'less glamorous' parts of adventures,
    from finding enemy strongholds to unraveling mysterious figures like the Black Spider.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    He has great respect for the party and despite having walked into some questionable interactions with them,
    he considers them good friends and dependable allies.
</p>

<p>
    When delivered the news about Saren being a potential traitor, he was more than willing to help the party out and
    began talking with old friend and calling in even older favours in an attempt to sort out exact what is happening.
</p>
<p>
    Though such an endeavour has undoubtedly brought on quite a bit of stress - as evidenced by the empty ale cups
    seldom seen around him - he continues to assist wherever he can. His faith in the party and their abilities must be
    quite strong indeed!
