    The boisterous and energetic owner of the Stonehill Inn in Phandalin. Always there with a caring ear,
    an uplifting joke, and a strong drink, he can be relied upon to raise your spirits in any circumstance.
    Despite his overly flirtatious nature, he is actually quite the gentleman and only means them as a bit of
    harmless fun.

    Incredibly thankful to the party for helping free the town from control of the Redbrands, he makes sure to
    always keep a few rooms prepared for them.
